Rediscover Knowledge What if every time you opened a PDF, it didnt just sit thereit spoke to you, connected ideas, and narrated meaning across your entire library? Thats the future were building  and we want you to help shape it. In the Connecting the Dots Challenge, your mission is to reimagine the humble PDF as an intelligent, interactive experienceone that understands structure, surfaces insights, and responds to you like a trusted research companion. The Journey Ahead  Round 1 Kick things off by building the brains  extract structured outlines from raw PDFs with blazing speed and pinpoint accuracy. Then, power it up with on-device intelligence that understands sections and links related ideas together.  Round 2 Its showtime! Build a beautiful, intuitive reading webapp using Adobes PDF Embed API. You will be using your Round 1 work to design a futuristic webapp. Why This Matters In a world flooded with documents, what wins is not more content  its context. Youre not just building tools  youre building the future of how we read, learn, and connect. No matter your background  ML hacker, UI builder, or insight whisperer  this is your stage. Are you in? Its time to read between the lines. Connect the dots. And build a PDF experience that feels like magic. Lets go.",

Your job is to extract a structured outline of the document  essentially the Title, and headings like H1, H2, and H3  in a clean, hierarchical format. This outline will be the foundation for the rest of your hackathon journey. Why This Matters PDFs are everywhere  but machines dont naturally understand their structure. By building an outline extractor, youre enabling smarter document experiences, like semantic search, recommendation systems, and insight generation.
